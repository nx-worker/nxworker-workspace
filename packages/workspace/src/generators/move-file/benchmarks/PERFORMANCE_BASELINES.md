# Performance Baselines

Last updated: 2025-10-23

## Overview

This document establishes baseline performance metrics for the move-file generator's modular functions after the Phase 1-9 refactoring.

## Benchmark Results

### Cache Operations

| Operation | Average Time | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cache hit | ~0.0001ms | File existence check with warm cache |
| Cache miss | ~0.013ms | First-time file existence check |
| Get source files (cached) | ~0.0001ms | Retrieve cached project source files |
| Update cache | ~0.0002ms | Single cache entry update |

**Environment**: Node.js 22.x, Ubuntu Linux (GitHub Actions runner)

**Analysis**: Cache operations are extremely fast, with warm cache hits measured at < 0.001ms. This validates the effectiveness of caching for file existence checks and project source file lookups.

### Path Resolution

| Operation                  | Average Time | Notes                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| buildFileNames             | ~0.0013ms    | Generate file name variants    |
| buildPatterns (100 files)  | ~0.015ms     | Build glob patterns for batch  |
| getRelativeImportSpecifier | ~0.004ms     | Calculate relative import path |
| toAbsoluteWorkspacePath    | ~0.0006ms    | Normalize path to absolute     |
| removeSourceFileExtension  | ~0.0002ms    | Strip file extension           |

**Analysis**: Path operations are very fast due to being pure string manipulation with no I/O. All operations complete in well under 1ms, with most under 0.01ms.

### Import Updates

| Operation | Average Time | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update imports (single file) | ~0.016ms | AST parse + transform |
| Update imports (10 files) | ~0.003ms | Batch import updates |
| AST transformation | ~0.015ms | Complex file with multiple imports |

**Analysis**: Import update operations are remarkably fast due to efficient AST caching and transformation. Even complex files with multiple imports complete in under 0.02ms.

### Export Management

| Operation                  | Average Time | Notes                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Export detection           | ~0.15ms      | Check if file is exported |
| Export addition            | ~0.22ms      | Add export statement      |
| Export removal             | ~0.27ms      | Remove export statement   |
| Bulk operations (20 files) | ~3.3ms       | Add 20 export statements  |

**Analysis**: Export management operations are slightly slower due to file I/O and content parsing, but still very fast. Bulk operations scale linearly as expected.

### Validation Operations

| Operation | Average Time | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check for relative imports - no imports | ~2.9ms | Scan 20 files with no imports |
| Check for relative imports - with imports | ~0.16ms | Scan files to find relative import |
| Check for relative imports - nested paths | ~0.16ms | Handle complex path resolution |
| Check for relative imports - large project | ~7.4ms | Scan 100 files in large project |
| Check for unexported dependencies - no imports | ~0.14ms | Simple file with no dependencies |
| Check for unexported dependencies - multiple imports | ~0.54ms | File with 10 relative imports |
| Check for unexported dependencies - large file | ~1.13ms | File with 20 relative imports |

**Analysis**: Validation operations leverage AST parsing and caching for efficient import analysis. The `checkForUnexportedRelativeDependencies` function shows good performance even with large files (20 imports in ~1.13ms). Performance scales roughly linearly with the number of imports analyzed.

## Key Findings

1. **Excellent cache performance**: Sub-millisecond cache operations validate the caching strategy
2. **Fast path operations**: Pure string manipulation completes in microseconds
3. **Efficient AST operations**: Import updates benefit from AST caching, completing much faster than expected
4. **Reasonable I/O performance**: Export management operations complete quickly despite file I/O overhead
5. **Linear scaling**: Bulk operations scale linearly with the number of files as expected
6. **Efficient validation**: New validation operations show good performance with AST caching, handling complex dependency checks efficiently

## Performance Trends

### Optimization Impact

The Phase 1-9 refactoring focused on maintainability and testability, with performance as a secondary consideration. Key observations:

- **Cache operations**: Excellent performance with sub-millisecond cache hits
- **Path operations**: Very fast due to string manipulation (no I/O)
- **Import updates**: Limited by AST parsing/transformation (inherent complexity)
- **Export management**: Reasonable performance for file I/O operations
- **Validation operations**: Benefit from AST caching, achieving good performance for dependency analysis

### Scaling Characteristics

- **Cache operations**: O(1) with hash-based lookups
- **Path operations**: O(1) or O(n) where n is path length (typically < 100 chars)
- **Import updates**: O(n × m) where n = files, m = imports per file
- **Export management**: O(n) where n = existing exports in entrypoint
- **Validation operations**: O(n × m) where n = files scanned, m = imports per file analyzed

## Performance Regression Detection

### Automated CI Checks ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: Benchmark regression detection using github-action-benchmark with tinybench is now active on all pull requests!

The CI system automatically:

1. Runs all micro-benchmark tests using tinybench via Jest
2. Parses benchmark results (ops/sec in benchmark.js format)
3. Compares against historical data stored in GitHub Pages
4. Fails PRs if regressions exceed 150% threshold
5. Posts comments and job summaries showing regressions

**See:** [Benchmark README](./README.md)

### Regression Threshold

A regression is flagged if performance degrades by more than **150%** (i.e., becomes 2.5x slower).

This threshold is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
alert-threshold: '150%'
```

### Managing Regressions

**Automated workflow:**

- PR benchmarks compare against main branch baseline
- github-action-benchmark posts comments on regressions
- Historical data updates automatically on merge to main
- Performance charts available on GitHub Pages

**Accepting intentional regressions:**

- Document the trade-off in PR description
- Reviewers approve despite regression
- Baseline updates automatically when merged

### Investigation Process

**Automated in CI**: The regression detection system now runs automatically on all pull requests.

If regression detected:

1. **Review the CI output** - See which benchmark(s) are slower and by how much
2. **Identify the cause**:
   - Review commits in the PR for performance-impacting changes
   - Look at changes to affected modules (cache, path-utils, import-updates, etc.)
3. **Decide on action**:
   - **Unintentional regression**: Fix the code causing the slowdown
   - **Intentional trade-off**: Update baseline if accepting performance cost for other benefits
4. **Update baseline if needed**:
   - The baseline updates automatically when merged to main
   - No manual baseline management needed with github-action-benchmark
   - Historical data stored in GitHub Pages branch

**Automated Alerts**: CI will fail the PR and show:

- Which benchmarks regressed
- Baseline vs current performance
- Percentage change and threshold
- Instructions for updating baselines

## Future Optimization Opportunities

Based on benchmark results, potential optimizations:

1. **Import updates**: Consider caching parsed ASTs to avoid re-parsing
2. **Export management**: Batch export operations to reduce file I/O
3. **Path operations**: Memoize frequently-used path calculations
4. **Cache operations**: Consider LRU eviction for memory-constrained environments
